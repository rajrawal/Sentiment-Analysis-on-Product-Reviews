## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in NLP that helps in understanding the sentiment expressed in textual data. This project aims to classify product reviews into positive and negative sentiments using machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains product reviews from e-commerce platforms. It includes text reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). The dataset can be found [here](#) (link to the dataset if available).

## Data Preprocessing

- Removing HTML tags and special characters
- Converting text to lowercase
- Removing stopwords
- Tokenizing text
- Stemming or lemmatizing words

## Feature Extraction

Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Model Training

- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a logistic regression model using `sklearn`
- Explored other models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualized the confusion matrix to understand misclassifications

## Visualization

- Plotted the distribution of positive and negative reviews
- Created word clouds for positive and negative reviews to highlight common terms

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved high accuracy in classifying reviews as positive or negative. The visualizations provided insights into the most frequent words in each sentiment category.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and machine learning in performing sentiment analysis on product reviews. By accurately classifying sentiments, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer feedback and improve their products and services.
